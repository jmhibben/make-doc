# `make-story`

This is a utility project designed to streamline the process of converting document sets into another filetype. While the inspiration for creating this utility is my own writing, my goal is to create a utility that can be used to create any document type available by the specified converter. By default, `make-story` uses `pandoc` for conversion, but this can be changed via configuration files or command-line options.
